Title: Hundreds dead as boats sink off Libya, survivors tell UN
At least 240 people are feared to have drowned in the southern Mediterranean, bringing the annual total to 4,220 – the highest in the Mediterranean on record. About 100 people drowned when an inflatable dinghy capsized shortly after leaving the Libyan coast on Wednesday, some of the 29 survivors told the UN refugee agency. A further 140 are thought to have drowned in a second incident in another rubber boat early on Thursday morning. Only two people appear to have survived the second tragedy. The survivors’ testimonies “were all very consistent”, a spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency, Carlotta Sami, said in a telephone interview. “They report two shipwrecks, both not far from the Libyan shore, and they report the boats were in a very bad condition. Many women, pregnant women and children were onboard, and they were in the water for hours.” Risking death in the Mediterranean: the least bad option for so many migrants Read more Though the numbers migrating from Turkey to Greece have dropped drastically since March after an agreement between the EU and Turkey, crossings between Libya and Italy are still at near-record levels. Nearly 160,000 people have reached Italy so far this year from Libya, already more than last year’s annual total, and within sight of the 2014 record of 170,000.
